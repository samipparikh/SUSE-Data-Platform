#### Data Platform: The Challenge

The changing landscape of Data technologies is growing at a rapid pace. The traditional database market has grown into various different areas ranging from legacy enterprise support to embedded device analytics.  And a wide-range of competing and complementary products can be used in an interchangeable format.

The goal of the Data solutions Partner stack is to identify partners in the data operations space which complement one another, and augment value add of SUSE technology and hardware partners.  By design, each module is intended to avoid lock-in and encourage flexibility of a solution to address existing market needs
