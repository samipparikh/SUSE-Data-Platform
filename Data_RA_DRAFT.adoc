#### Data Platform: The Challenge

The changing landscape of data technologies is growing at a rapid pace. The traditional database market has grown into various different areas ranging from legacy enterprise support to embedded device analytics.  And a wide-range of competing and complementary products can be used in an interchangeable format.

The goal of the Data solutions Partner stack is to identify partners in the data operations space which complement one another, and augment value add of SUSE technology and hardware partners.  By design, each module is intended to avoid lock-in and encourage flexibility of a solution to address existing market needs


#### SUSE : The Solution
The SUSE One Partner Stacks will allow partners the flexibility to tailor components based on their go to market and sales execution goals.  Components will allow like-for-like swapping of hardware brands, cloud platforms, or complementary software layers.

#### IOT Use cases
Building and Operating Your IoT Apps
What You Need From Your Data Platform

#### High-Speed Data Ingest and Real-Time Analytics
Each new generation of ‘thing’ comes with new sensors, emitting unprecedented volumes of data and providing new insights into the business. Building and operating IoT applications requires a data platform capable of ingesting massive volumes of sensor and event data with concurrent support for real-time analysis to flag anomalies and critical events as they happen.

#### Event-Driven, Real-Time Architecture
An event-driven architecture creates a data pipeline where event producers – devices and gateways in your IoT network – generate a stream of events, and event consumers listen and react to those events in near real time. Producers and consumers are all decoupled from each other, which removes dependencies between components, and the system can grow and shrink in response to demand.

#### Intelligent Edge
Today the compute power of the cloud is moving to the edge. Instead of sending every bit of data from the sensor to the cloud, edge devices are becoming more intelligent, pre-aggregating data, performing analytics locally, and synchronizing data to the cloud. Not only does this reduce network traffic, it also allows for business insights to be made locally, increasing productivity.

#### Fast, Flexible Development Experience
Time series applications capture and measure state changes over time and are often used to predict the future and establish operational system thresholds. Building and operating IoT applications requires a data platform with a flexible data model to accommodate complex and quickly changing time series data generated by fleets of heterogeneous sensors and connected devices.
Our Intelligent Data Platform Supports Your IoT Apps from Edge to Core
From the devices at the edge of the network to the IoT applications at the core, our Intelligent Data Platform (IDP) accelerates and de-risks the delivery and operation of your IoT applications. We start with MongoDB, the world’s most popular database, and bind in complementary technologies such as Apache Kafka to become part of an integrated, event-driven IoT platform.

#### Target platforms
- SLES
- Virtualized
- Container (CF or K8s)
- CSP
- Hybrid (On-Premise / CSP)

#### Analytics

Ease: Documents match objects in code, making it faster and easier for developers to build new IoT apps. JSON is the language of APIs, which means you can use the same data model and syntax from the device to the backend. This increases developer productivity and enhances both efficient API design and data model consistency

Flexibility: Add new time series data elements, sensors, and devices without the need to wrangle with database schema changes

Versatility: Query IoT data any way you want to support rich application functionality, real-time analytics, and user experience

Integration: Work seamlessly with all of the leading systems for streaming data, machine learning, BI, and more

Security: Robust access controls, auditing, and encryption controls protect valuable IoT data both in flight and at rest
