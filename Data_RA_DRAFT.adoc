#### Data Platform: The Challenge

The changing landscape of Data technologies is growing at a rapid pace. The traditional database market has grown into various different areas ranging from legacy enterprise support to embedded device analytics.  And a wide-range of competing and complementary products can be used in an interchangeable format.

The goal of the Data solutions Partner stack is to identify partners in the data operations space which complement one another, and augment value add of SUSE technology and hardware partners.  By design, each module is intended to avoid lock-in and encourage flexibility of a solution to address existing market needs


#### SUSE : The Solution
The SUSE One Partner Stacks will allow partners the flexibility to tailor components based on their go to market and sales execution goals.  Components will allow like-for-like swapping of hardware brands, cloud platforms, or complementary software layers.

#### Modular Configurations

In that context, data partners can be categorized into several buckets.  Important to note, many of these can be interchangeable for a final customer solutions.  Categories discussed include:
SQL-based relational database management systems
•	Oracle Database
•	MySQL
•	Microsoft SQL Server
•	PostgreSQL
•	Maria DB

Non-relational DB (unstructured)
•	Redis
•	MongoDB
•	Couchbase Server
•	Neo4j
•	JanusGraph
•	Apache Cassandra
•	Hbase


#### What are the components of an	operator service?

.A Closer Look: The Data Scientist
The Data Scientist is the most important element in any Artificial Intelligence inititive. The more time she can spend creating, analyzing, and refining her data models more chances of success the project will have. Unfortunately, the reality is that there are several other elements of the project that will siphone off her time.
