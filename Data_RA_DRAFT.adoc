#### Data Platform: The Challenge

The changing landscape of Data technologies is growing at a rapid pace. The traditional database market has grown into various different areas ranging from legacy enterprise support to embedded device analytics.  And a wide-range of competing and complementary products can be used in an interchangeable format.

The goal of the Data solutions Partner stack is to identify partners in the data operations space which complement one another, and augment value add of SUSE technology and hardware partners.  By design, each module is intended to avoid lock-in and encourage flexibility of a solution to address existing market needs


#### SUSE : The Solution
The SUSE One Partner Stacks will allow partners the flexibility to tailor components based on their go to market and sales execution goals.  Components will allow like-for-like swapping of hardware brands, cloud platforms, or complementary software layers.

#### Modular Configurations

In that context, data partners can be categorized into several buckets.  Important to note, many of these can be interchangeable for a final customer solutions'.  Categories discusses include
SQL-based relational database management systems
•	Oracle Database
•	MySQL
•	Microsoft SQL Server
•	PostgreSQL
•	Maria DB
Non-relational DB (unstructured)
•	Redis
•	MongoDB
•	Couchbase Server
•	Neo4j
•	JanusGraph
•	Apache Cassandra
•	Hbase



.A Closer Look: The Data Scientist
The Data Scientist is the most important element in any Artificial Intelligence inititive. The more time she can spend creating, analyzing, and refining her data models more chances of success the project will have. Unfortunately, the reality is that there are several other elements of the project that will siphone off her time.

Often, Data Scientists prefer to build, and initally test, their models on their own local workstation. This gives them full control of the AI platform and tends to work well for the initial process of model development. However, to move the model into the next phases of development, the work needs to continue with more computing power and a much larger data set. In addition, many data processing and model tuning steps must be taken as the model (and even multiple variations of the model) continue through development.

Unfortunately, far too often a data science team will perform many of these operations manually, or with custom scripts and "one-off" tools. In the end, they will spend more time cultivating a custom ecosphere for a single project than developing the model. While most every data scientist understands the benefit of leveraging AI pipeline systems such as Apache Airflow and Kubeflow, it also represents even more work to learn and code the meta language to convert all of the data processing and model validation/tuning steps into a pipeline. This is where the SUSE {productname} fulfills its promise of keeping data scientists focused on creative endeavors. By analyzing the ML model, the SUSE {productname} can determine the flow of tasks required to develop a funcioning pipeline for the model development. During this analysis, the {productname} will develop and display a directed acyclic graph the tasks and even show the progress of an analytic run of the model through the graph.

Translating the data analysis model into a full pipeline that collects, organizes and cleans the larger dataset; provides the desired final output (NTS: Need much better view of what it takes to go from basic model to runnable pipeline) takes valuable time that the Data Scientist could be using to continue to build a model into a production ready artifact.

Once an ML model has been adapted to a more powerful AI platform, whether that is through custom scripts or pipeline software, the project team will often prefer to stick to that platform, rather than face having to recreate the work it took to adapt it the first time. This means some teams may start with overly costly platforms and other may stay with underperforming platforms longer than they should. Fortnately, the users of the SUSE {productname} have left those worries far behind. The {productname} desire to avoid having to adapt data models to a new analysis platform can slow productivity and eventually doom the project entirely.

What is desparetly need is the flexibility to run data models on various AI platforms in a highly dynamic way. By automatically adapting the data model to the chosen AI platform, SUSE AI Orchestrator relieves the Data Scientist of the burden of learning each AI platform and lets him focus on what he does best.
